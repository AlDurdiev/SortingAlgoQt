# SortingAlgoQt
Short program for implementing sorting algorithms with visualization using Qt framework. It's an short training project of C++.


This program shows different sorting algorithms working with UI and timed out to be easy to watch. 
You can watch sorting algorithms in use during their process and I hope it would help some beginners to understand those sorting algorithms. 

I created it to train myself in C++, I didn't used C++ for some time, so I'm slowly trying to comming back to it.
I used Qt Library for the UI to practice a bit this huge library.

You are free to re-use this code even if it's not deeply tested (not any unit test).


You can open this project easily with Qt Creator for test it in debugging mode or compile it in another way (you'll need Qt librairy).
